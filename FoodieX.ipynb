    "Some ideas of conclusions could include: trying to identify the trending restaurants with your own scoring algorithm (can be as simple as the best rating or most votes or both!), clustering restaurant locations to figure out the optimized FoodieX pick up zones, estimating cook time based on restaurant info, and demonstrating your findings using a data visualization tool. As an important member of the FoodieX team, you get to come up with your own analysis! So try your best to dig out any useful information out of this data set. The sky's the limit! ðŸ¤“!\n",
